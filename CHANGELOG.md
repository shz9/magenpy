## [0.0.12] - 2023-02-12

### Changed

- Removed the `--fast-math` compiler flag due to concerns about 
numerical precision (e.g. [Beware of fast-math](https://simonbyrne.github.io/notes/fastmath/)).
- Updated implementation of `SumstatsParser` class to allow user to specify `read_csv_kwargs` at the point of instantiation.
- Updated plink executors to propagate the error messages to the user.
- Updated `merge_snp_tables` to allow for merges on columns other than `SNP`.
- Refactored, cleaned, and updated the implementation of the `AnnotationMatrix` class.
- Fixed bug in `GWADataLoader.split_by_samples()`: Need to perform `deepcopy`, otherwise splitting would not work properly.
- Updated `read_annotations` method in `GWADataLoader` to work with the latest `AnnotationMatrix` interfaces.
- Fixed bug in the `manhattan` plotting function.

### Added

- Added parsers for functional annotations and annotation files. Mainly support LDSC annotation format for now.
- Added a utility method to `GWADataLoader` called `align_with` to streamline aligning `GWADataLoader` objects across SNP and sample dimensions.
- Added utility methods for flattening the LD matrix in `LDMatrix`.
- Added a method to perform matrix-vector multiplication in `LDMatrix`.
- Added a method to perform block-wise iteration in the `LDMatrix` class.

## [0.0.11] - 2022-09-06

### Changed

- Fixed bug in implementation of `identify_mismatched_snps`.
- Fixed bugs in handling of missing information in LD matrix.
- Fixed bug in handling of covariates in `SampleTable`.
- Updated `README` file to remove line indicators `>>>` from sample code.

### Added

- Added the reference allele `A2` to the output of the `true_beta_table` 
in `GWASimulator`.

## [0.0.10] - 2022-08-22

### Changed

- Fixed a bug in the phenotype likelihood inference in `SampleTable`.
- Changed the implementation of the `merge_snp_tables` utility function to 
check for BOTH reference and alternative alleles.
- Modified implementation of `score` method of `GWADataLoader` to correct 
potential issues with the BETAS being for a subset of the chromosomes.

### Added

- A utility method to `GenotypeMatrix` called `estimate_memory_allocation`. This should 
allow the user to gauge the memory resources required to interact with the 
genotype files.

## [0.0.9] - 2022-08-09

### Changed

- Fixing bug in computing minor allele frequency with `plink`.

## [0.0.8] - 2022-08-09

### Added

- Added the reference allele `A2` to the list of attributes of `LDMatrix`.
- Added `effect_sign` as a property of `SumstatsTable`.

### Changed

- Fixed implementation of `merge_snp_tables` to detect allele differences that
are not flips between `A1`/`A2`.
- Improved implementation of `.score` method of `xarrayGenotypeMatrix`.

## [0.0.7] - 2022-07-12

### Added

- Added `tqdm` progress bars when processing multiple files/chromosomes 
  in `GWADataLoader`.

### Added

- Utility function to compute the genomic control or lambda factor.
- A method to set the causal SNPs directly in `GWASimulator`.

  other summary stats (e.g. p-value).

method of `GWASimulator`.
- Modified the LD score computation method to allow for aggregating LD scores 
by functional category or annotations.
- Streamlining module import structure to speed up loading.

## [0.0.5] - 2022-06-28

### Changed

### Changed

have the same set of chromosomes.

## [0.0.3] - 2022-06-26

### Added

- New methods to split `GWADataLoader` objects by chromosome and by samples. 
The latter should come in handy for splitting the samples for training, validation and testing.

### Changed

- Updated implementation of the shrinkage estimator of LD to align it more closely 
with the original formulation in Wen and Stephens (2010) and implementations in RSS software.
- Fixed various bugs and errors in the code.

    - Genotype matrices: `GenotypeMatrix`
    - Sample tables: `SampleTable`
    - Summary statistics table: `SumstatsTable`
- Added a new `stats` submodule that implements utilities and functions 
to compute various statistics, including `ld` (SNP correlation matrix), 
  `h2` (heritability), `score`, `transforms`, `variant` statistics, and `gwa` 
  (genome-wide association testing).
  
- Added a modular class for summary statistics parsers `SumstatsParser`.
- Added modular interfaces for `executors`, representing external software, 
such as `plink`.
- Added support for window size specifications using number of SNPs and distance
in kilobases.
